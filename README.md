## Explore the Brand New Version 3.3

### Ultimate Burglary/House Robbery Script for FiveM 🪛

**Update 3.3** marks the start of our journey to an all-in-one robbery resource. Take on **T4**, the challenge of a high-stakes, action-packed mission to rob a heavily guarded weapons cache. Navigate through layers of security: evade patrol guards, disable CCTV, crack the security keypad, and avoid triggering a lockdown that could spawn a formidable boss guard.

### What's New in 3.3?

- **🔒 Lockdown Mechanic**: Triggered by CCTV, a boss guard may spawn. Disable it with the ‘heistaxe’ item and smash the correct power box.
- **🏠 Interior Overhaul**: Over 240 new objects and 35+ items, courtesy of Evelynn. All interiors are packed with detail!
- **📋 New Free Menu**: Introducing sk-menu, recommended for smooth auto-refreshing items in the sell menu, but optional sk-menu.
- **📈 Reworked Reputation System**: Easier configuration, rep rewarding, and new XP calculation.
- **🔐 Improved Safe Opening**: No more instantly spawning open safes. A proper opening safe scene will now play.
- **💰 New Sell Mechanic**: Items are randomly selected at resource start, with prices changing based on demand and rarity.
- **🛡️ Outdoor Security**: Guards, keypads, alarms, power box, and CCTV for Tier 4.
- **⚡ Enhanced Interactions**: Smoother animations for keypads, safes, and power boxes.
- **⚙️ Improved Setup and Loading**: Refactored SetupInterior for smoother loading and reduced blackscreen time.
